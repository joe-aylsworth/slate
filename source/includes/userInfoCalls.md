# GetAvailablePermissionList

 

Retrieves a comma-separated array of all permissions that can be assigned to a user.

An administrator or superuser can set permissions for each user on an API-call by API-call basis, to allow for highly granular control. Common permission sets include *Trading, Deposit,* and *Withdrawal* (which allow trading, deposit of funds, and account withdrawals, respectively); or *AdminUI, UserOperator,* and *AccountOperator* (which allow control of the Order Management System, set of users, or an account). See [“Permissions” on page 4 ](#_bookmark7)for more information, but a complete discussion of permissions and their scope is beyond this API guide.
